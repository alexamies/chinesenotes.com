        The lotus is a symbol of purity and perfection in Buddhism because it grows out of the mud but is not defiled. The flower is also esteemed by Daoists, being the symbol of He Xianggu 何仙姑, one of the eight immortals. Many parts of the lotus are used for eating, medicine, and herbal tea, including the seeds, stamen, petals, kernel, and root.
