毛詩序：「《下武》，繼文也。武王有聖德，復受天命，能昭先人之功焉。」


下武
下武維周，世有哲王。三后在天，王配于京。

Successors tread in the steps [of their predecessors] in our Zhou.
For generations there had been wise kings;
The three sovereigns were in heaven;
And king [Wu] was their worthy successor in his capital.

王配于京，世德作求。永言配命，成王之孚。

King [Wu] was their worthy successor in his capital,
Rousing himself to seek for the hereditary virtue,
Always striving to accord with the will [of Heaven];
And thus he secured the confidence due to a king.

成王之孚，下土之式。永言孝思，孝思維則。

He secured the confidence due to a king,
And became a pattern of all below him.
Ever thinking how to be filial,
His filial mind was the model [which he supplied].

媚茲一人，應侯順德。永言孝思，昭哉嗣服。

Men loved him, the One man,
And responded [to his example] with a docile virtue.
Ever thinking how to be filial,
He brilliantly continued the doings [of his fathers].

昭茲來許，繩其祖武。於萬斯年，受天之祜。

Brilliantly! and his posterity,
Continuing to walk in the steps of their forefathers,
For myriads of years,
Will receive the blessing of Heaven.

受天之祜，四方來賀。於萬斯年，不遐有佐。

They will receive the blessing of Heaven.
And from the four quarters [of the kingdom] will felicitations come to them.
For myriads of years,
Will there not be their helpers?


《下武》，六章，章四句。
