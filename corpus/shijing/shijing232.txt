毛詩序：「《黍苗》，刺幽王也。不能膏潤天下，卿士不能行召伯之職焉。」


黍苗
芃芃黍苗，陰雨膏之。悠悠南行，召伯勞之。

Tall and strong grows the young millet,
Fattened by the genial rains.
Very long was our journey to the south,
But the earl of Shao encouraged and cheered us.

我任我輦，我車我牛。我行既集，蓋云歸哉。

We carried our burdens; we pushed along our barrows;
We drove our waggons; we led our oxen.
When our expedition was accomplished,
We knew we should return.

我徒我御，我師我旅。我行既集，蓋云歸處。

We went along on foot; we rode in our chariots; -
Our whole host, and our battalions.
When our expedition was accomplished,
We knew we should return home.

肅肅謝功，召伯營之。烈烈征師，召伯成之。

Severe was the work at Xie,
But the earl of Shao built the city.
Majestic was the march of our host; -
The earl of Shao directed it.

原隰既平，泉流既清。召伯有成，王心則寧。

The plains and low lands were regulated; -
The springs and streams were cleared.
The earl of Shao completed his work,
And the heart of the king was at rest.

《黍苗》，五章，章四句。
