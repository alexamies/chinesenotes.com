毛詩序：「《草蟲》，大夫妻能以禮自防也。」

草蟲
喓喓草蟲，趯趯阜螽，未見君子，憂心忡忡，亦既見止，亦既覯止，我心則降。

Yao-yao went the grass-insects,
And the hoppers sprang about.
While I do not see my lord,
My sorrowful heart is agitated.
Let me have seen him,
Let me have met him,
And my heart will then be stilled.

陟彼南山，言采其蕨，未見君子，憂心惙惙，亦既見止，亦既覯止，我心則說。

I ascended that hill in the south,
And gathered the turtle-foot ferns.
While I do not see my lord,
My sorrowful heart is very sad.
Let me have seen him,
Let me have met him,
And my heart will then be pleased.

陟彼南山，言采其薇，未見君子，我心傷悲，亦既見止，亦既覯止，我心則夷。

I ascended that hill in the south,
And gathered the thorn-ferns.
While I do not see my lord,
My sorrowful heart is wounded with grief.
Let me have seen him,
Let me have met him,
And my heart will then be at peace.
