毛詩序：「《猗嗟》，刺魯莊公也。齊人傷魯莊公有威儀技藝，然而不能以禮防閑其母。失子之道，人以為齊侯之子焉。」


猗嗟
猗嗟昌兮！頎而長兮。抑若揚兮，美目揚兮。巧趨蹌兮。射則臧兮。

Alas for him, so handsome and accomplished!
How grandly tall!
With what elegance in his high forehead!
With what motion of his beautiful eyes!
With what skill in the swift movements of his feet!
With what mastery of archery!

猗嗟名兮！美目清兮。儀既成兮，終日射侯，不出正兮，展我甥兮。

Alas for him, so famous!
His beautiful eyes how clear!
His manners how complete!
Shooting all day at the target,
And never lodging outside the bird-square!
Indeed our [ruler's] nephew!

猗嗟孌兮！清揚婉兮。舞則選兮，射則貫兮，四矢反兮，以禦亂兮。

Alas for him, so beautiful!
His bright eyes and high forehead how lovely!
His dancing so choice!
Sure to send his arrows right through!
The four all going to the same place!
One able to withstand rebellion!

《猗嗟》，三章，章六句。
