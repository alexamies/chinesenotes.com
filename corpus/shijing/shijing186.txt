毛詩序：「《鴻鴈》，美宣王也。萬民離散，不安其居，而能勞來還定，安集之，至于矜寡，無不得其所焉。」


鴻鴈
鴻鴈于飛，肅肅其羽。之子于征，劬勞于野。爰及矜人，哀此鰥寡。

The wild geese are flying about;
Su-su goes the rustle of their wings.
[There were] those officers engaged on the commission.
Pained were we and toiled in the open fields;
All were objects of pity,
But alas for those wifeless and widows!

鴻鴈于飛，集于中澤。之子于垣，百堵皆作。雖則劬勞，其究安宅。

The wild geese are flying about;
And they settle in the midst of the marsh.
[There were] those officers directing the rearing of the walls; -
Five thousand cubits of them arose at once.
Though there was pain and toil,
In the end we had rest in our dwellings.

鴻鴈于飛，哀鳴嗸嗸。維此哲人，謂我劬勞。維彼愚人，謂我宣驕。

The wild geese are flying about,
And melancholy is their cry of ao-ao.
There were they, wise men,
Who recognized our pain and toil;
If they had been stupid men,
They would have said we were proclaiming our insolence.

《鴻鴈》，三章，章六句。
