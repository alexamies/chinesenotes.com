毛詩序：「《綢繆》，刺晉亂也。國亂則婚姻不得其時焉。」


綢繆
綢繆束薪，三星在天。今夕何夕？見此良人！子兮子兮！如此良人何！

Round and round the firewood is bound;
And the Three Stars appear in the sky.
This evening is what evening,
That I see this good man?
O me! O me!
That I should get a good man like this!

綢繆束芻，三星在隅。今夕何夕？見此邂逅！子兮子兮！如此邂逅何！

Round and round the grass is bound;
And the Three Stars are seen from the corner.
This evening is what evening,
That we have this unexpected meeting?
Happy pair! Happy pair!
That we should have this unexpected meeting!

綢繆束楚，三星在戶。今夕何夕？見此粲者！子兮子兮！如此粲者何！

Round and round the thorns are bound;
And the Three Stars are seen from the door.
This evening is what evening,
That I see this beauty?
O me! O me!
That I should see a beauty like this!

《綢繆》，三章，章六句。
