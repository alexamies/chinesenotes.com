毛詩序：「《燕燕》，衞莊姜送歸妾也。」


燕燕
燕燕于飛，差池其羽，之子于歸，遠送于野，瞻望弗及，泣涕如雨。

The swallows go flying about,
With their wings unevenly displayed.
The lady was returning [to her native state],
And I escorted her far into the country.
I looked till I could no longer see her,
And my tears fell down like rain.

燕燕于飛，頡之頏之，之子于歸，遠于將之，瞻望弗及，佇立以泣。

The swallows go flying about,
Now up, now down.
The lady was returning [to her native state],
And far did I accompany her.
I looked till I could no longer see her,
And long I stood and wept.

燕燕于飛，下上其音，之子于歸，遠送于南，瞻望弗及，實勞我心。

The swallows go flying about;
From below, from above, comes their twittering.
The lady was returning [to her native state],
And far did I escort her to the south.
I looked till I could no longer see her,
And great was the grief of my heart.

仲氏任只，其心塞淵，終溫且惠，淑慎其身，先君之思，以勗寡人。

Lovingly confiding was lady Zhong;
Truly deep was her feeling.
Both gentle was she and docile,
Virtuously careful of her person.
In thinking of our deceased lord,
She stimulated worthless me.

《燕燕》，四章，章六句。
