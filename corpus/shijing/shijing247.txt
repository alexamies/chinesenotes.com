毛詩序：「《靈臺》，民始附也。文王受命，而民樂其有靈德，以及鳥獸昆蟲焉。」


靈臺
經始靈臺，經之營之。
庶民攻之，不日成之。
經始勿亟，庶民子來。

When he planned the commencement of the marvellous tower,
He planned it, and defined it;
And the people in crowds undertook the work,
And in no time completed it.
When he planned the commencement, [he said], ' Be not in a hurry; '
But the people came as if they were his children.

王在靈囿，麀鹿攸伏。
麀鹿濯濯，白鳥翯翯。
王在靈沼，於牣魚躍。

The king was in the marvellous park,
Where the does were lying down, -
The does, so sleek and fat;
With the white birds glistening.
The king was by the marvellous pond; -
How full was it of fishes leaping about!

虡業維樅，賁鼓維鏞。
於論鼓鍾，於樂辟廱。

On his posts was the toothed face-board, high and strong,
With the large drums and bells.
In what unison were their sounds!
What joy was there in the hall with its circlet of water!

於論鼓鍾，於樂辟廱。
鼉鼓逢逢，矇瞍奏公。

In what unison sounded the drums and bells!
What joy was there in the hall with its circlet of water!
The lizard-skin drums rolled harmonious,
As the blind musicians performed their parts.

《靈臺》，五章，章四句。
