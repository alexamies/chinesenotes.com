毛詩序：「《思齊》，文王所以聖也。」


思齊
思齊大任，文王之母，思媚周姜。京室之婦，大姒嗣徽音，則百斯男。

Pure and reverent was Da-ren,
The mother of king Wen;
Loving was she to Zhou Jiang; -
A wife becoming the House of Zhou.
Da-si inherited her excellent fame,
And from her came a hundred sons.

惠于宗公，神罔時怨，神罔時恫。刑于寡妻，至于兄弟，以御于家邦。

He conformed to the example of his ancestors,
And their Spirits had no occasion for complaint.
Their Spirits had no occasion for dissatisfaction,
And his example acted on his wife,
Extended to his brethren,
And was felt by all the clans and States.

雝雝在宮，肅肅在廟。不顯亦臨，無射亦保。

Full of harmony was he in his palace;
Full of reverence in the ancestral temple.
Out of sight he still felt as under inspection;
Unweariedly he maintained [his virtue].

肆戎疾不殄，烈假不瑕。不聞亦式，不諫亦入。

Though he could not prevent [some] great calamities,
His brightness and magnanimity were without stain.
Without previous instruction he did what was right;
Without admonition, he went on [in the path of goodness].

肆成人有德，小子有造。古之人無斁，譽髦斯士。

So, grown up men became virtuous [through him],
And young men made [constant] attainments.
[Our] ancient prince never felt weariness,
And from him were the fame and eminence of his officers.

《思齊》，四章：章六句。故言五章：二章，章六句；三章，章四句。
