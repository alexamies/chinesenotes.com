毛詩序：「《白華》，周人刺幽后也。幽王取申女以為后，又得襃姒而黜申后，故下國化之，以妾為妻，以孽代宗。而王弗能治。周人為之作是詩也。」


小雅‧魚藻之什‧白華

白華菅兮，白茅束兮。之子之遠，俾我獨兮。

The fibres from the white flowered rush,
Are bound with the white grass.
This man's sending me away,
Makes me dwell solitary.

英英白雲，露彼菅茅。天步艱難，之子不猶。

The light and brilliant clouds,
Bedew the rush and the grass.
The way of Heaven is hard and difficult; -
This man does not confirm [to good principle].

滮池北流，浸彼稻田。嘯歌傷懷，念彼碩人。

How the water from the pools flows away to north,
Flooding the rice fields!
I whistle and sing with wounded heart,
Thinking of that great man.

樵彼桑薪，卬烘于煁。維彼碩人，實勞我心。

They gather firewood of branches of the mulberry trees,
And I burn them [only] in a [small] furnace.
That great man,
Does indeed toil and trouble my heart.

鼓鍾于宮，聲聞于外。念子懆懆，視我邁邁。

Their drums and bells are beaten in the palace,
And their sound is heard without.
All-sorrowful I think of him; -
He thinks of me without any regard.

有鶖在梁，有鶴在林。維彼碩人，實勞我心。

The marabou is on the dam;
The [common] crane is in the forest.
That great man,
Does indeed toil and trouble my heart.

鴛鴦在梁，戢其左翼。之子無良，二三其德。

The Yellow ducks are on the dams,
With their left wings gathered up.
That man is bad,
Ever varying in his conduct.

有扁斯石，履之卑兮。之子之遠，俾我疧兮。

How thin is that slab of stone!
He that stands on it is low.
That man's sending me away,
Makes me full of affliction.

《白華》，八章，章四句。
