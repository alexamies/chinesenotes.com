毛詩序：「《君子偕老》，刺衞夫人也。夫人淫亂，失事君子之道，故陳人君之德，服飾之盛，宜與君子偕老也。」


君子偕老
君子偕老，副笄六珈，委委佗佗，如山如河，象服是宜，子之不淑，云如之何。

The husband's to their old age,
In her headdress, and the cross-pins, with their six jewels;
Easy and elegant in her movements;
[Stately] as a mountain, [majestic]as a river,
Well beseeming her pictured robes:
[But] with your want of virtue, O lady,
What have you to do with these things?

玼兮玼兮，其之翟也，鬒髮如雲，不屑髢也，玉之瑱也，象之揥也，揚且之晳也，胡然而天也，胡然而帝也。

How rich and splendid
Is her pheasant-figured robe!
Her black hair in masses like clouds,
No false locks does she descend to.
There are her ear-plugs of jade,
Her comb-pin of ivory,
And her high forehead, so white.
She appears like a visitant from heaven!
She appears like a goddess!

瑳兮瑳兮，其之展也，蒙彼縐絺，是紲袢也，子之清揚，揚且之顏也，展如之人兮，邦之媛也。

How rich and splendid
Is her robe of state!
It is worn over the finest muslin of dolichos,
The more cumbrous and warm garment being removed.
Clear are her eyes; fine is her forehead;
Full are her temples.
Ah! such a woman as this!
The beauty of the country!

《君子偕老》，三章：一章七句，一章九句，一章八句。

註解
呂氏曰：「首章之末云『子之不淑，云如之何』，責之也；二章之末云『胡然而天也，胡然而帝也』，問之也；三章之末云『展如之人兮，邦之媛也』，惜之也。辭益惋而意益深矣。」[1]
