毛詩序：「《小戎》，美襄公也。備其兵甲，以討西戎。西戎方彊，而征伐不休，國人則矜其車甲，婦人能閔其君子焉。」


小戎
小戎俴收，五楘梁輈，游環脅驅，陰靷鋈續，文茵暢轂，駕我騏馵。言念君子，溫其如玉。在其板屋，亂我心曲。

[There is] his short war carriage; -
With the ridge-like end of its pole, elegantly bound in five places;
With its slip rings and side straps,
And the traces attached by gilt rings to the masked transverse;
With its beautiful mat of tiger's skin, and its long naves;
With its piebalds, and horses with white left feet.
When I think of my husband [thus],
Looking bland and soft as a piece of jade;
Living there in his plank house;
It sends confusion into all the corners of my heart.

四牡孔阜，六轡在手，騏駵是中，騧驪是驂，龍盾之合，鋈以觼軜。言念君子，溫其在邑。方何為期，胡然我念之。

His four horses are in very fine condition,
And the six reins are in the hand [of the charioteer].
Piebald, and bay with black mane, are the insides;
Yellow with black mouth, and black, are the outsides;
Side by side are placed the dragon-figured shields;
Gilt are the buckles for the inner reins.
I think of my husband [thus],
Looking so mild in the cities there.
What time can be fixed for his return?
Oh! how I think of him!

俴駟孔羣，厹矛鋈錞，蒙伐有苑，虎韔鏤膺，交韔二弓，竹閉緄縢。言念君子，載寢載興。厭厭良人，秩秩德音。

His mail-covered team moves in great harmony;
There are the trident spears with their gilt ends;
And the beautiful feather-figured shield;
With the tiger-skin bow-case, and the carved metal ornaments on its front.
The two bows are placed in the case,
Bound with string to their bamboo frames.
I think of my husband,
When I lie down and rise up.
Tranquil and serene is the good man,
With his virtuous fame spread far and near.

《小戎》，三章，章十句。
