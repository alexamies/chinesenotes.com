毛詩序：「《晨風》，刺康公也。忘穆公之業，始棄其賢臣焉。」


晨風
鴥彼晨風，鬱彼北林，未見君子，憂心欽欽，如何如何，忘我實多。

Swift flies the falcon,
To the thick-wooded forest in the north.
While I do not see my husband,
My heart cannot forget its grief.
How is it, how is it,
That he forgets me so very much?

山有苞櫟，隰有六駮，未見君子，憂心靡樂，如何如何，忘我實多。

On the mountain are the bushy oaks;
In the low wet grounds are six elms.
While I do not see my husband,
My sad heart has no joy.
How is it, how is it,
That he forgets me so very much?

山有苞棣，隰有樹檖，未見君子，憂心如醉，如何如何，忘我實多。

On the mountain are the bushy sparrow-plums;
In the low wet grounds are the high, wild pear trees.
While I do not see my husband,
My heart is as if intoxicated with grief.
How is it, how is it,
That he forgets me so very much?

《晨風》，三章，章六句。
