毛詩序：「《四月》，大夫刺幽王也。在位貪殘，下國構禍，怨亂並興焉。」


四月
四月維夏，六月徂暑。先祖匪人？胡寧忍予？

In the fourth month comes summer,
And in the sixth month the heat begins to decrease.
Were not my forefathers men?
How can they endure that I should be [thus]?

秋日淒淒，百卉具腓。亂離瘼矣，爰其適歸？

The autumn days become cold,
And the plants all decay.
Amid such distress of disorder and dispersion,
Whither can I betake myself?

冬日烈烈，飄風發發。民莫不穀，我獨何害？

The winter days are very fierce,
And the storm blows in rapid gusts.
People all are happy;
Why do I alone suffer this misery?

山有嘉卉，侯栗侯梅。廢為殘賊，莫知其尤。

On the mountain are fine trees, -
Chestnut trees and plum trees.
Of their degenerating into ravening thieves,
I know not the evil cause.

相彼泉水，載清載濁。我日構禍，曷云能穀？

Look at the water of that spring,
Sometimes clear, sometimes muddy.
I am every day coming into contact with misfortune;
How can I be happy?

滔滔江漢，南國之紀。盡瘁以仕，寧莫我有。

Grandly flow the Jiang and the Han,
Regulators of the southern States.
Worn out as I am with service,
He yet takes no notice of me.

匪鶉匪鳶，翰飛戾天。匪鱣匪鮪，濳逃于淵。

I am not an eagle nor a hawk,
Which flies aloft to heaven.
I am not a sturgeon, large or small,
Which can dive and hide in the deep.

山有蕨薇，隰有杞桋。君子作歌，維以告哀。

On the hills are the turtle-foot and thorn ferns;
In the marshes are the medlar and the yi.
I, an officer, have made this song,
To make known my plaint.

《四月》，八章，章四句。
