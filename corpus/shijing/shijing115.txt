毛詩序：「《蟋蟀》，刺晉僖公也。儉不中禮，故作是詩以閔之。欲其及時以禮自虞樂也，此晉也而謂之唐，本其風俗，憂深思遠，儉而用禮，乃有堯之遺風焉。」


蟋蟀
蟋蟀在堂，歲聿其莫。今我不樂，日月其除。無已大康，職思其居。好樂無荒，良士瞿瞿。

The cricket is in the hall,
And the year is drawing to a close.
If we do not enjoy ourselves now,
The days and months will be leaving us.
But let us not go to great excess;
Let us first think of the duties of our position;
Let us not be wild in our love of enjoyment.
The good man is anxiously thoughtful.

蟋蟀在堂，歲聿其逝。今我不樂，日月其邁。無已大康，職思其外。好樂無荒，良士蹶蹶。

The cricket is in the hall,
And the year is passing away.
If we do not enjoy ourselves now,
The days and months will have gone.
But let us not go to great excess;
Let us first send our thoughts beyond the present;
Let us not be wild in our love of enjoyment.
The good man is ever diligent.

蟋蟀在堂，役車其休。今我不樂，日月其慆。無已大康，職思其憂。好樂無荒，良士休休。

The cricket is in the hall,
And our carts stand unemployed.
If we do not enjoy ourselves now,
The days and months will have gone by.
But let us not go to an excess;
Let us first think of the griefs that may arise;
Let us not be wild in our love of enjoyment.
The good man is quiet and serene.

《蟋蟀》，三章，章八句。
