毛詩序：「《日月》，衞莊姜傷己也。遭州吁之難，傷己不見荅於先君，以至困窮之詩也。」


日月
日居月諸，照臨下土，乃如之人兮，逝不古處，胡能有定，寧不我顧。

O sun; O moon,
Which enlighten this lower earth!
Here is the man,
Who treats me not according to the ancient rule.
How can he get his mind settled?
Would he then not regard me?

日居月諸，下土是冒，乃如之人兮，逝不相好，胡能有定，寧不我報。

O sun; O moon,
Which overshadow this lower earth!
Here is this man,
Who will not be friendly with me.
How can he get his mind settled?
Would he then not respond to me?

日居月諸，出自東方，乃如之人兮，德音無良，胡能有定，俾也可忘。

O sun; O moon,
Which come forth from the east!
Here is the man,
With virtuous words, but really not good.
How can he get his mind settled?
Would he then allow me to be forgotten?

日居月諸，東方自出，父兮母兮，畜我不卒，胡能有定，報我不述。

O sun; o moon,
From the east which come forth!
O father, O mother,
There is no sequel to your nourishing of me.
How can he get his mind settled?
Would he then respond to me, contrary to all reason?
