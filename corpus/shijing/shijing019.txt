毛詩序：「《羔羊》，鵲巢之功致也，召南之國化文王之政，在位皆節儉正直，德如羔羊也。」

羔羊
羔羊之皮，素絲五紽，退食自公，委蛇委蛇。

[Those] lamb-skins and sheep-skins,
With their five braidings of white silk!
They have retired from the court to take their their meal;
Easy are they and self-possesed.

羔羊之革，素絲五緎，委蛇委蛇，自公退食。

[Those] lamb-skins and sheep-skins,
With their five seams wrought with white silk!
Easy are they and self-possessed;
They have retired from the court to take their their meal.

羔羊之縫，素絲五緫，委蛇委蛇，退食自公。

The seams of [those] lamb-skins and sheep-skins,
The five joinings wrought with white silk!
Easy are they and self-possessed;
They have retired to take their their meal from the court.

《羔羊》，三章，章四句。
