毛詩序：「《南山》，刺襄公也。鳥獸之行，淫乎其妹，大夫遇是惡，作詩而去之。」


南山
南山崔崔，雄狐綏綏。魯道有蕩，齊子由歸。既曰歸止，曷又懷止！

High and large is the south hill,
And a male fox is on it, solitary and suspicious.
The way to Lu is easy and plain,
And the daughter of Qi went by it to her husband's.
Since she went to her husband's,
Why do you further think of her?

葛屨五兩，冠緌雙止。魯道有蕩，齊子庸止。既曰庸止，曷又從止！

The five kinds of dolichos shoes are [made] in pairs,
And the string-ends of a cap are made to match;
The way to Lu is easy and plain,
And the daughter of Qi travelled it.
Since she travelled it,
Why do you still follow her?

蓺麻如之何？衡從其畝。取妻如之何？必告父母，既曰告止，曷又鞠止！

How do we proceed in planting hemp?
The acres must be dressed lengthwise and crosswise.
How do we proceed in taking a wife?
Announcement must first be made to our parents.
Since such announcement was made,
Why do you still indulge her desires?

析薪如之何？匪斧不克。取妻如之何？匪媒不得，既曰得止，曷又極止！

How do we proceed in splitting firewood?
Without an axe it cannot be done.
How do we proceed in taking a wife?
Without a go-between it cannot be done.
Since this was done,
Why do you still allow her to go to this extreme?

《南山》，四章，章六句。
