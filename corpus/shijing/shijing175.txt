毛詩序：「《南有嘉魚》，樂與賢也。太平君子至誠，樂與賢者共之也。」


南有嘉魚
南有嘉魚，烝然罩罩。君子有酒，嘉賓式燕以樂。

In the south is the barbel,
And, in multitudes, they are taken under baskets.
The host has spirits,
On which his admirable guests feast with him joyfully.

南有嘉魚，烝然汕汕。君子有酒，嘉賓式燕以衎。

In the south is the barbel,
And, in multitudes, they are taken with wicker nets.
The host has spirits,
On which his admirable guests feast with him, delighted.

南有樛木，甘瓠纍之。君子有酒，嘉賓式燕綏之。

In the south are trees with curved drooping branches,
And the sweet gourds cling to them.
The host has spirits,
On which his admirable guests feast with him cheerfully.

翩翩者鵻，烝然來思。君子有酒，嘉賓式燕又思。

The Filial doves keep flying about,
Coming in multitudes.
The host has spirits,
On which his admirable guests feast with him again and again.


《南有嘉魚》，四章，章四句。
