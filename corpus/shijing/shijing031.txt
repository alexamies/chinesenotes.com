毛詩序：「《終風》，衞莊姜傷己也。遭州吁之暴，見侮慢而不能正也。」


終風
終風且暴，顧我則笑，謔浪笑敖，中心是悼。

The wind blows and is fierce,
He looks at me and smiles,
With scornful words and dissolute, - the smile of pride.
To the center of my heart I am grieved.

終風且霾，惠然肯來，莫往莫來，悠悠我思。

The wind blows, with clouds of dust.
Kindly he seems to be willing to come to me;
[But] he neither goes nor comes.
Long, long, do I think of him.

終風且曀，不日有曀，寤言不寐，願言則嚏。

The wind blew, and the sky was cloudy;
Before a day elapses, it is cloudy again.
I awake, and cannot sleep;
I think of him, and gasp.

曀曀其陰，虺虺其靁，寤言不寐，願言則懷。

All cloudy is the darkness,
And the thunder keeps muttering.
I awake and cannot sleep;
I think of him, and my breast is full of pain.

《終風》，四章，章四句。
