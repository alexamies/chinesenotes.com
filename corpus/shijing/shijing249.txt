毛詩序：「《文王有聲》，繼伐也。武王能廣文王之聲，卒其伐功也。」


文王有聲
文王有聲，遹駿有聲。遹求厥寧，遹觀厥成。文王烝哉。

King Wen is famous;
Yea, he is very famous.
What he sought was the repose [of the people];
What he saw was the completion [of his work].
A sovereign true was king Wen!

文王受命，有此武功。既伐于崇，作邑于豐。文王烝哉。

King Wen received the appointment [of Heaven],
And achieved his martial success.
Having overthrown Chong,
He fixed his [capital] city in Feng.
A sovereign true was king Wen!

築城伊淢，作豐伊匹。匪棘其欲，遹追來孝。王后烝哉。

He repaired the walls along the [old] moat :
His establishing himself in Feng was according to [the pattern of his forefathers],
It was not that he was in haste to gratify his wishes; -
It was to show the filial duty which had come down to him.
A sovereign true was [our] royal prince!

王公伊濯，維豐之垣。四方攸同，王后維翰。王后烝哉。

His royal merit was brightly displayed,
By those walls of Feng.
There were collected [the sympathies of the people of] the four quarters,
Who regarded the royal prince as their protector.
A sovereign true was [our] royal prince!

豐水東注，維禹之績。四方攸同，皇王維辟。皇王烝哉。

The Feng-water flowed on to the east [of the city],
Through the meritorious labour of Yu.
There were collected [the sympathies of the people of ] the four quarters,
Who would have the great king as their ruler.
A sovereign true was the great king!

鎬京辟廱，自西自東。自南自北，無思不服。皇王烝哉。

In the capital of Hao he built his hall with its circlet of water;
From the west to the east,
From the south to the north,
There was not a thought but did him homage.
A sovereign true was the great king!

考卜維王，宅是鎬京。維龜正之，武王成之。武王烝哉。

He examined and divined, did the king,
About settling in the capital of Hao.
The tortoise-shell decided the site,
And king Wu completed the city.
A sovereign true was king Wu!

豐水有芑，武王豈不仕。詒厥孫謀，以燕翼子。武王烝哉。

By the Feng-water grows the white millet; -
Did not king Wu show wisdom in his employment of officers?
He would leave his plans to his descendants,
And secure comfort and support to his son.
A sovereign true was king Wu!
