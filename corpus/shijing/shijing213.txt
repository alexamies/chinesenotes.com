毛詩序：「《鼓鍾》[1]，刺幽王也。」


鼓鍾
鼓鍾將將，淮水湯湯。憂心且傷。淑人君子，懷允不忘。

His bells ring out jiang-jiang,
While the waters of the Huai go sweeping on;
Sad is my heart and wouded.
The virtuous sovereigns [of old], -
In my heart, indeed, I cannot forget them.

鼓鍾喈喈，淮水湝湝。憂心且悲。淑人君子，其德不回。

His drums ring out jie-jie,
While the waters of the Huai rush along;
My heart is sad and grieved.
Of the virtuous sovereigns [of old],
The virtue was without flaw.

鼓鍾伐鼛，淮有三洲。憂心且妯。淑人君子，其德不猶。

His bells ring out, his large drums resound,
There are the three islands in the Huai;
Sad is my heart and moved.
Of the virtuous sovereigns [of old],
The virtue was different from this.

鼓鍾欽欽，鼓瑟鼓琴。笙磬同音。以雅以南，以籥不僭。

His bells ring out qin-qin;
His lutes, large and small, give their notes;
The tones of his organs and sounding stones are in unison.
They sing the Ya and the Nan,
Dancing to their flutes without error.


《鼓鍾》，四章，章五句。
