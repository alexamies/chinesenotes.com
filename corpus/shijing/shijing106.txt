毛詩序：「《載驅》，齊人刺襄公也。無禮義，故盛其車服，疾驅於通道大都，與文姜淫播其惡於萬民焉。」


載驅
載驅薄薄，簟茀朱鞹。魯道有蕩，齊子發夕。

She urges on her chariot rapidly,
With its screen of bamboos woven in squares, and its vermilion coloured leather.
The way from Lu is easy and plain,
And the daughter of Qi started on it in the evening.

四驪濟濟，垂轡濔濔。魯道有蕩，齊子豈弟。

Her four black horses are beautiful,
And soft look the reins as they hang.
The way from Lu is easy and plain,
And the daughter of Qi is delighted and complacent.

汶水湯湯，行人彭彭。魯道有蕩，齊子翱翔。

The waters of the Wen flow broadly on;
The travellers are numerous.
The way from Lu is easy and plain,
And the daughter of Qi moves on with unconcern.

汶水滔滔，行人儦儦。魯道有蕩，齊子遊敖。

The waters of the Wen sweep on;
The travellers are in crowds.
The way from Lu is easy and plain,
And the daughter of Qi proceeds at her ease.

《載驅》，四章，章四句。
