毛詩序：「《陟岵》，孝子行役思念父母也。國迫而數侵削，役乎大國，父母兄弟離散，而作是詩也。」


陟岵
陟彼岵兮，瞻望父兮。父曰：「嗟！予子行役，夙夜無已；上慎旃哉，猶來無止！」

I ascend that tree-clad hill,
And look towards [the residence of] my father.
My father is saying, ' Alas! my son, abroad on the public service,
Morning and night never rests.
May he be careful,
That he may come [back], and not remain there! '

陟彼屺兮，瞻望母兮。母曰：「嗟！予季行役，夙夜無寐；上慎旃哉！猶來無棄！」

I ascend that bare hill,
And look towards [the residence of] my mother.
My mother is saying, ' Alas! my child, abroad on the public service,
Morning and night has no sleep.
May he be careful,
That he may come [back], and not leave his body there! '

陟彼岡兮，瞻望兄兮。兄曰：「嗟！予弟行役，夙夜必偕；上慎旃哉！猶來無死！」

I ascend that ridge,
And look towards [the residence of] my elder brother.
My brother is saying, ' Alas! my younger brother, abroad on the public service,
Morning and night must consort with his comrades.
May he be careful,
That he may come back, and not die! '

《陟岵》，三章，章六句。
