毛詩序：「《既醉》，大平也。醉酒飽德，人有士君子之行焉。」


既醉
既醉以酒，既飽以德。君子萬年，介爾景福。

You have made us drink to the full of your spirits;
You have satiated us with your kindness,
May you enjoy, O our lord, myriads of years!
May your bright happiness [ever] be increased!

既醉以酒，爾殽既將。君子萬年，介爾昭明。

You have made us drink to the full of your spirits;
Your viands were all set out before us.
May you enjoy, O our lord, myriads of years!
May your bright intelligence [ever] be increased!

昭明有融，高朗令終。令終有俶，公尸嘉告。

May your bright intelligence become perfect,
High and brilliant, leading to a good end!
That good end has [now] its beginning:
The personator of your ancestors announced it in his blessing.

其告維何？籩豆靜嘉。朋友攸攝，攝以威儀。

What was his announcement?
' [ The offerings in] your dishes of bamboo and wood are clean and fine.
Your friends asisting at the service,
Have done their part with reverent demeanour.

威儀孔時，君子有孝子。孝子不匱，永錫爾類。

' Your reverent demeanour was altogether what the occasion required,
And not yours only, but that also of your filial son.
For such filial piety, without ceasing,
There will ever be conferred blessing on you.

其類維何？室家之壼。君子萬年，永錫祚胤。

' What will the blessings be?
That along the passages of your palace,
You shall move for ten thousand years;
And there will be granted to you for ever dignity and posterity.

其胤維何？天被爾祿。君子萬年，景命有僕。

' How as to your posterity?
Heaven invests you with your dignity,
Yea for ten thousand years,
The bright appointment is attached to your person.

其僕維何？釐爾女士。釐爾女士，從以孫子。

' How will it be attached?
There is given you a heroic wife.
There is given you a heroic wife,
And from her shall come [the line of] descendants. '


《既醉》，八章，章四句。
