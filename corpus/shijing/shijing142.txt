毛詩序：「《墓門》，刺陳佗也。陳佗無良師傅，以至於不義，惡加於萬民焉。」


墓門
墓門有棘，斧以斯之。夫也不良，國人知之。知而不已，誰昔然矣。

At the gate to the tombs there are jujube trees; -
They should be cut away with an axe.
That man is not good,
And the people of the State know it.
They know it, but he does not give over; -
Long time has it been thus with him.

墓門有梅，有鴞萃止。夫也不良，歌以訊之。訊予不顧，顛倒思予。

At the gate to the tombs there are plum trees;
And there are owls collecting on them.
That man is not good,
And I sing [this song] to admonish him.
I admonish him, but he will not regard me; -
When he is overthrown, he will think of me.

《墓門》，二章，章六句。
