毛詩序：「《假樂》，嘉成王也。」


假樂
假樂君子，顯顯令德。宜民宜人，受祿于天。保右命之，自天申之。

Of [our] admirable, amiable, sovereign,
Most illustrious is the excellent virtue.
He orders rightly the people, orders rightly the officers,
And receives his dignity from heaven,
Which protects and helps him, and [confirms] his appointment,
By repeated acts of renewal from heaven.

干祿百福，子孫千億。穆穆皇皇，宜君宜王。不愆不忘，率由舊章。

[So] does he seek for the emoluments of dignity, [and obtain] all blessings, -
Thousands and hundreds of thousands of descendants,
Of reverent virtue and admirable character,
Fit to be rulers [of States], fit to be king,
Erring in nothing, forgetful of nothing,
Observing and following the old statutes.

威儀抑抑，德音秩秩。無怨無惡，率由羣匹。受福無疆，四方之綱。

[May they] manifest all self-restraint in deportment,
And their virtuous fame be without fail!
Without resentments, without dislikes,
[May they] give free course to [the good among] the officers,
Receiving blessing without limit,
And regulating all within the four quarters [of the kingdom]!

之綱之紀，燕及朋友。百辟卿士，媚于天子。不解于位，民之攸塈。

Regulating all, and determining each point,
Giving repose to his friends,
All the princes and ministers,
Will love the son of Heaven.
Not idly occupying his office,
The people will find rest in him.


《假樂》，四章，章六句。
