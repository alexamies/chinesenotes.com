毛詩序：「《鳲鳩》，刺不壹也。在位無君子，用心之不壹也。」

鳲鳩
鳲鳩在桑　其子七兮　淑人君子　其儀一兮　其儀一兮　心如結兮　

The turtle dove is in the mulberry tree,
And her young ones are seven.
The virtuous man, the princely one,
Is uniformly correct in his deportment.
He is uniformly correct in his deportment,
His heart is as if it were tied to what is correct.

鳲鳩在桑　其子在梅　淑人君子　其帶伊絲　其帶伊絲　其弁伊騏　

The turtle dove is in the mulberry tree,
And her young ones are in the plum tree.
The virtuous man, the princely one,
Has his girdle of silk.
His girdle is of silk,
And his cap is of spotted deer-skin.

鳲鳩在桑　其子在棘　淑人君子　其儀不忒　其儀不忒　正是四國　

The turtle dove is in the mulberry tree,
And her young ones are in the jujube tree.
The virtuous man, the princely one,
Has nothing wrong in his deportment.
He has nothing wrong in his deportment,
And thus he rectifies the four quarters of the State.

鳲鳩在桑　其子在榛　淑人君子　正是國人　正是國人　胡不萬年

The turtle dove is in the mulberry tree,
And her young ones are in the hazel tree.
The virtuous man, the princely one,
Rectifies the people of the State.
He rectifies the people of his State:
May he continue for ten thousand years!

鳲鳩
