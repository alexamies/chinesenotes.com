毛詩序：「《訪落》，嗣王謀於廟也。」


訪落
訪予落止，率時昭考。
於乎悠哉！朕未有艾。將予就之，繼猶判渙。
維予小子，未堪家多難。紹庭上下，陟降厥家。
休矣皇考！以保明其身。

I take counsel at the beginning of my [rule],
How I can follow [the example] of my shrined father.
Ah! far-reaching [were his plans],
And I am not yet able to carry them out.
However I endeavour to reach to them,
My continuation of them will still be all-deflected.
I am [but as] a little child,
Unequal to the many difficulties of the State.
In his room, [I will look for him] to go up and come down in the court,
To ascend and descend in the house.
Admirable art thou, O great Father,
[Condescend] to preserve and enlighten me.


《訪落》，一章，十二句。
