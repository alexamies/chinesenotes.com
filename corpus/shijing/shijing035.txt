毛詩序：「《匏有苦葉》，刺衞宣公也。公與夫人並為淫亂。」


匏有苦葉
匏有苦葉，濟有深涉，深則厲，淺則揭。

The gourd has [still] its bitter leaves,
And the crossing at the ford is deep.
If deep, I will go through with my clothes on;
If shallow, I will do so, holding them up.

有瀰濟盈，有鷕雉鳴，濟盈不濡軌，雉鳴求其牡。

The ford is full to overflowing;
There is the note of the female pheasant.
The full ford will not wet the axle of my carriage;
It is the pheasant calling for her mate.

雝雝鳴鴈，旭日始旦，士如歸妻，迨冰未泮。

The wild goose, with its harmonious notes,
At sunrise, with the earliest dawn,
By the gentleman, who wishes to bring home his bride,
[Is presented] before the ice is melted.

招招舟子，人涉卬否，人涉卬否，卬須我友。

The boatman keeps beckoning;
And others cross with him, but I do not.
Others cross with him, but I do not; -
I am waiting for my friend.

《匏有苦葉》，四章，章四句。
