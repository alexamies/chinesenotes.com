毛詩序：「《山有樞》，刺晉昭公也。不能脩道以正其國，有財不能用，有鍾鼓不能以自樂，有朝廷不能洒埽，政荒民散，將以危亡，四鄰謀取其國家而不知。國人作詩以刺之也。」


山有樞
山有樞，隰有榆。子有衣裳，弗曳弗婁。子有車馬，弗馳弗驅。宛其死矣，他人是愉。

On the mountains are the thorny elms,
In the low, wet grounds are the white elms.
You have suits of robes,
But you will not wear them;
You have carriages and horses,
But you will not drive them.
You will drop off in death,
And another person will enjoy them.

山有栲，隰有杻。子有廷內，弗洒弗埽。子有鐘鼓，弗鼓弗考。宛其死矣，他人是保。

On the mountains is the Kao,
In the low wet grounds is the Niu.
You have courtyards and inner rooms,
But you will not have them sprinkled or swept;
You have drums and bells,
But you will not have them beat or struck,
You will drop off in death,
And another person will possess them.

山有漆，隰有栗。子有酒食，何不日鼓瑟？且以喜樂，且以永日。宛其死矣，他人入室。

On the mountains are the varnish trees,
In the low wet grounds are the chestnuts.
You have spirits and viands; -
Why not daily play your lute?
Both to give a zest to your joy,
And to prolong the day?
You will drop off in death,
And another person will enter your chamber.


《山有樞》，三章，章八句。
