毛詩序：「《伐檀》，刺貪也。在位貪鄙，無功而受祿，君子不得進仕爾。」


伐檀
坎坎伐檀兮，寘之河之干兮，河水清且漣猗。不稼不穡，胡取禾三百廛兮！不狩不獵，胡瞻爾庭有縣貆兮。彼君子兮，不素餐兮。

Kan-kan go his blows on the sandal trees,
And he places what he hews on the river's bank,
Whose waters flow clear and rippling.
You sow not nor reap; -
How do you get the produce of those three hundred farms?
You do not follow the chase; -
How do we see the badgers hanging up in your court-yards?
O that superior man!
He would not eat the bread of idleness!

坎坎伐輻兮，寘之河之側兮，河水清且直猗。不稼不穡，胡取禾三百億兮！不狩不獵，胡瞻爾庭有縣特兮。彼君子兮，不素食兮。

Kan-kan go his blows on the wood for his spokes,
And he places it by the side of the river,
Whose waters flow clear and even.
You sow not nor reap; -
How do you get your three millions of sheaves?
You do not follow the chase; -
How do we see those three-year-olds hanging in your court-yards?
O that superior man!
He would not eat the bread of idleness!

坎坎伐輪兮，寘之河之漘兮，河水清且淪猗。不稼不穡，胡取禾三百囷兮！不狩不獵，胡瞻爾庭有縣鶉兮。彼君子兮，不素飧兮。

Kan-kan go his blows on the wood for his wheels,
And he places it by the lip of the river,
Whose waters flow clear in rippling circles.
You sow not nor reap; -
How do you get the paddy for your three hundred round binns?
You do not follow the chase; -
How do we see the quails hanging in your court-yards?
O that superior man!
He would not eat the bread of idleness!

《伐檀》，三章，章九句。
