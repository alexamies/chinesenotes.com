毛詩序：「《雞鳴》，思賢妃也。哀公荒淫怠慢，故陳賢妃貞女，夙夜警戒相成之道焉。」


雞鳴
雞既鳴矣，朝既盈矣。匪雞則鳴，蒼蠅之聲。

' The cock has crowed;
The court is full. '
But it was not the cock that was crowing; -
It was the sound of the blue flies.

東方明矣，朝既昌矣。匪東方則明，月出之光。

' The east is bright;
The court is crowded. '
But it was not the east that was bright; -
It was the light of the moon coming forth.

蟲飛薨薨，甘與子同夢。會且歸矣，無庶予子憎！

' The insects are flying in buzzing crowds;
It would be sweet to lie by you and dream. '
But the assembled officers will be going home; -
Let them not hate both me and you. '

《雞鳴》，三章，章四句。
