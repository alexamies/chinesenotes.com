毛詩序：「《都人士》，周人刺衣服無常也[1]。古者長民，衣服不貳，從容有常，以齊其民，則民德歸壹。傷今不復見古人也。」


都人士
彼都人士，狐裘黃黃。其容不改，出言有章。行歸于周，萬民所望。

Those officers of the [old] capital,
With their fox-furs so yellow,
Their deportment unvaryingly [correct],
And their speech full of elegance! -
If we could go back to [the old] Zhou,
They would be admiringly looked up to by all the people.

彼都人士，臺笠緇撮。彼君子女，綢直如髮。我不見兮，我心不說。

Those officers of the [old] capital,
With their hats of Tai leaves and small black caps! -
Those ladies of noble Houses.
With their hair so thick and straight! -
I do not see them [now],
And my heart is dissatisfied.

彼都人士，充耳琇實。彼君子女，謂之尹吉。我不見兮，我心苑結。


Those officers of the [old] capital,
With their ear-plugs of xiu-stones! -
Those ladies of noble Houses,
Each fit to be called a Yin or a Ji! -
I do not see them [now],
And my heart grieves with indissoluble sorrow.

彼都人士，垂帶而厲。彼君子女，卷髮如蠆。我不見兮，言從之邁。

Those officers of the [old] capital,
With their girdles hanging elegantly down! -
Those ladies of great Houses,
With their [side] hair curving up like a scorpion's tail! -
I do not see them [now],
[If I could], I would walk along after them.

匪伊垂之，帶則有餘。匪伊卷之，髮則有旟。我不見兮，云何盱矣。

Not that they purposely let their girdles hang down; -
The girdles were naturally long.
Not that they gave their hair that curve; -
The hair had a natural curl.
I do not see them [now],
And how do I long for them!

《都人士》，五章，章六句。
