毛詩序：「《碩人》，閔莊姜也。莊公惑於嬖妾，使驕上僭，莊姜賢而不荅，終以無子，國人閔而憂之。」


碩人
碩人其頎，衣錦褧衣，齊侯之子，衛侯之妻，東宮之妹，邢侯之姨，譚公維私。

Large was she and tall,
In her embroidered robe, with a [plain] single garment over it:
The daughter of the marquis of Qi.
The wife of the marquis of Wei,
The sister of the heir-son of Qi
The sister-in-law of the marquis of Xing,
The viscount of Tan also her brother-in-law.

手如柔荑，膚如凝脂，領如蝤蠐，齒如瓠犀，螓首蛾眉，巧笑倩兮，美目盻兮。

Her fingers were like the blades of the young white-grass;
Her skin was like congealed ointment;
Her neck was like the tree-grub;
Her teeth were like melon seeds;
Her forehead cicada-like; her eyebrows like [the antenne of] the silkworm moth;
What dimples, as she artfully smiled!
How lovely her eyes, with the black and white so well defined!

碩人敖敖，說于農郊，四牡有驕，朱幩鑣鑣，翟茀以朝，大夫夙退，無使君勞。

Large was she and tall,
When she halted in the cultivated suburbs.
Strong looked her four horses,
With the red ornaments so rich about their bits.
Thus in her carriage, with its screens of pheasant feathers,
she proceeded to our court.
Early retire, ye great officers,
And do not make the marquis fatigued!

河水洋洋，北流活活，施罛濊濊，鱣鮪發發，葭菼揭揭，庶姜孽孽，庶士有朅。

The waters of the He, wide and deep,
Flow northwards in majestic course.
The nets are dropt into them with a plashing sound,
Among shoals of sturgeon, large and small,
While the rushes and sedges are rank about.
Splendidly adorned were her sister ladies;
Martial looked the attendant officers.

《碩人》，四章，章七句。
