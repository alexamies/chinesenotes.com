毛詩序：「《泉水》，衞女思歸也。嫁於諸侯，父母終，思歸寧而不得，故作是詩以自見也。」


泉水
毖彼泉水，亦流于淇，有懷于衞，靡日不思，孌彼諸姬，聊與之謀。

How the water bubbles up from that spring,
And flows away to the Qi!
My heart is in Wei;
There is not a day I do not think of it.
Admirable are those, my cousins;
I will take counsel with them.

出宿于泲，飲餞于禰，女子有行，遠父母兄弟，問我諸姑，遂及伯姊。

When I came forth, I lodged in Ji,
And we drank the cup of convoy at Ni.
When a young lady goes [to be married],
She leaves her parents and brothers;
[But] I would ask for my aunts,
And then for my elder sister.

出宿于干，飲餞于言，載脂載舝，還車言邁，遄臻于衞，不瑕有害。

I will go forth and lodge in Gan,
And we drink the cup of convoy at Yan.
I will grease the axle and fix the pin,
And the returning chariot will proceed.
Quickly shall we arrive in Wei; -
But would not this be wrong?

我思肥泉，茲之永歎，思須與漕，我心悠悠，駕言出遊，以寫我憂。

I think of the Feiquan,
I am ever sighing about it.
I think of Xu and Cao,
Long, long, my heart dwells with them.
Let me drive forth and travel there,
To dissipate my sorrow.

《泉水》，四章，章六句。
