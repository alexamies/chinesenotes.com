毛詩序：「《淇奧》，美武公之德也。有文章，又能聽其規諫，以禮自防，故能入相于周，美而作是詩也。」


淇奧
瞻彼淇奧，綠竹猗猗，有匪君子，如切如磋，如琢如磨，瑟兮僩兮，赫兮咺兮，有匪君子，終不可諼兮。

Look at those recesses in the banks of the Qi,
With their green bamboos, so fresh and luxuriant!
There is our elegant and accomplished prince, -
As from the knife and the file,
As from the chisel and the polisher!
How grave is he and dignified!
How commanding and distinguished!
Our elegant and accomplished prince, -
Never can he be forgotten!

瞻彼淇奧，綠竹青青，有匪君子，充耳琇瑩，會弁如星，瑟兮僩兮，赫兮咺兮，有匪君子，終不可諼兮。

Look at those recesses in the banks of the Qi,
With their green bamboos, so strong and luxuriant!
There is our elegant and accomplished prince, -
With his ear-stoppers of beautiful pebbles,
And his cap, glittering as with stars between the seams!
How grave is he and dignified!
How commanding and distinguished!
Our elegant and accomplished prince, -
Never can he be forgotten!

瞻彼淇奧，綠竹如簀，有匪君子，如金如錫，如圭如璧，寬兮綽兮，倚重較兮，善戲謔兮，不為虐兮。

Look at those recesses in the banks of the Qi,
With their green bamboos, so dense together!
There is our elegant and accomplished prince, -
[Pure] as gold or as tin,
[Soft and rich] as a sceptre of jade!
How magnanimous is he and gentle!
There he is in his chariot with its two high sides!
Skilful is he at quips and jokes,
But how does he keep from rudeness in them!

《淇奧》，三章，章九句。
