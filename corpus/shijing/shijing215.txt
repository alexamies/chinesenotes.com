毛詩序：「《信南山》，刺幽王也。不能脩成王之業，疆理天下，以奉禹功，故君子思古焉。」


信南山
信彼南山，維禹甸之。畇畇原隰，曾孫田之。我疆我理，南東其畝。

Yes, [all about] that southern hill,
Was made manageable by Yu.
Its plains and marshes being opened up,
It was made into fields by the distant descendant.
We define their boundaries, we form their smaller divisions,
And make the acres lie, here to the south, there to the east.

上天同雲，雨雪雰雰。益之以霢霂，既優既渥。既霑既足，生我百穀。

The heavens over head are one arch of clouds,
Snowing in multitudinous flakes.
There is superadded the drizzling rain.
When [the land] has received the moistening,
Soaking influence abundantly,
It produces all our kinds of grain.

疆埸翼翼，黍稷彧彧。曾孫之穡，以為酒食。畀我尸賓，壽考萬年。

The boundaries and smaller divisions are nicely adjusted,
And the millets yield abundant crops,
The harvest of the distant descendant.
We proceed to make therewith spirits and food,
To supply our representatives of the dead, and our guests; -
To obtain long life, extending over myriads of years.

中田有廬，疆埸有瓜。是剝是菹，獻之皇祖。曾孫壽考，受天之祜。

In the midst of the fields are the huts,
And along the bounding divisions are gourds.
The fruits is sliced and pickled,
To be presented to our great ancestors,
That their distant descendant may have long life,
And receive the blessing of Heaven.

祭以清酒，從以騂牡，享于祖考。執其鸞刀，以啟其毛，取其血膋。

We sacrifice [first] with pure spirits,
And then follow with a red bull;
Offering them to our ancestors.
[Our lord] holds the knife with tinkling bells,
To lay open the hair of the victim,
And takes its flesh and fat.

是烝是享，苾苾芬芬。祀事孔明，先祖是皇。報以介福，萬壽無疆。

Then we present, then we offer;
All round the fragrance is diffused.
Complete and brilliant is the sacrificial service;
Grandly come our ancestors.
They will reward [their descendant] with great blessing, -
Long life, years without end.
