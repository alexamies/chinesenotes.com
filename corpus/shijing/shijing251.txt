毛詩序：「《行葦》，忠厚也。周家忠厚，仁及草木，故能內睦九族，外尊事黃耇，養老乞言，以成其福祿焉。」[1]


行葦
敦彼行葦，牛羊勿踐履。方苞方體，維葉泥泥。
戚戚兄弟，莫遠具爾。或肆之筵，或授之几。

In thick patches are those rushes, springing by the way (-side);
Let not the cattle and sheep trample them.
Anon they will burst up; anon they will be completely formed,
With their leaves soft and glossy.
Closely related are brethren; -
Let none be absent, let all be near.
For some there are spread mats;
For some there are given stools [besides].

肆筵設席，授几有緝御。或獻或酢，洗爵奠斝。
醓醢以薦，或燔或炙。嘉殽脾臄，或歌或咢。

The mats are spread, and a second one above;
The stools are given, and there are plenty of servants.
[The guests] are pledged, and they pledge [the host] in return;
He rinses the cup, and the guests put theirs down.
Sauces and pickles are brought in,
With roast meat and broiled.
Excellent provisions there are [also] of tripe and cheek;
With singing to lutes, and with drums.

敦弓既堅，四鍭既鈞。舍矢既均，序賓以賢。
敦弓既句，既挾四鍭。四鍭如樹，序賓以不侮。

The ornamented bows are strong,
And the four arrows are all balanced.
They discharge the arrows, and all hit,
And the guests are arranged according to their skill.
The ornamented bows are drawn full,
And the four arrows are grasped in the hand.
They go straight to the mark as if planted in it,
And the quests are arranged by the humble propriety of their demeanour.

曾孫維主，酒醴維醹。酌以大斗，以祈黃耇。
黃耇台背，以引以翼，壽考維祺，以介景福。

The distant descendant presides over the feast;
His sweet spirits are strong.
He fills their cups from a measure,
And prays for the hoary old [among his quests]; -
That with hoary age and wrinkled back,
They may lead on one another [to virtue], and support one another [in it];
That so their old age may be blessed,
And their bright happiness [ever] increased.
