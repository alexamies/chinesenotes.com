毛詩序：「《執競》，祀武王也。」


執競
執競武王，無競維烈，不顯成康，上帝是皇。自彼成康，奄有四方。
斤斤其明！鐘鼓喤喤，磬筦將將，降福穰穰，降福簡簡，威儀反反。
既醉既飽，福祿來反。

The arm of king Wu was full of strength;
Irresistable was his ardour.
Greatly illustrious were Cheng and Kang,
Kinged by God.
When we consider how Cheng and Kang,
Grandly held all within the four quarters [of the kingdom],
How penetrating was their intelligence!
The bells and drums sound in harmony;
The sounding stones and flutes blend their notes;
Abundant blessing is sent down.
Blessing is sent down in large measure;
Careful and exact is all our deportment;
We have drunk, and we have eaten, to the full;
Our happiness and dignity will be prolonged.


《執競》，一章，十四句。
