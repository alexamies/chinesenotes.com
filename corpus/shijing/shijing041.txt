毛詩序：「《北門》，刺仕不得志也。言衞之忠臣不得其志爾。」


北門
出自北門，憂心殷殷，終窶且貧，莫知我艱，已焉哉，天實為之，謂之何哉。

I go out at the north gate,
With my heart full of sorrow.
Straitened am I and poor,
And no one takes knowledge of my distress.
So it is!
Heaven has done it; -
What then shall I say?

王事適我，政事一埤益我，我入自外，室人交徧讁我，已焉哉，天實為之，謂之何哉。

The king's business comes on me,
And the affairs of our government in increasing measure.
When I come home from abroad,
The members of my family all emulously reproach me.
So it is!
Heaven has done it; -
What then shall I say?

王事敦我，政事一埤遺我，我入自外，室人交徧摧我，已焉哉，天實為之，謂之何哉。

The king's business is thrown on me,
And the affairs of our government are left to me more and more.
When I come home from abroad,
The members of my family all emulously thrust at me.
So it is!
Heaven has done it; -
What then shall I say?

《北門》，三章，章七句。
