毛詩序：「《鳧鷖》，守成也。大平之君子，能持盈守成，神祇祖考安樂之也。」


鳧鷖
鳧鷖在涇，公尸來燕來寧。爾酒既清，爾殽既馨。公尸燕飲，福祿來成。

The wild-ducks and widgeons are on the King;
The personators of your ancestors feast and are happy.
Your spirits are clear,
Your viands are fragrant;
The personators of your ancestors feast and drink; -
Their happiness and dignity are made complete.

鳧鷖在沙，公尸來燕來宜。爾酒既多，爾殽既嘉。公尸燕飲，福祿來為。

The wild-ducks and widgeons are on the sand;
The personators of the dead enjoy the feast, their appropriate tribute.
Your spirits are abundant,
Your viands are good;
The personators of your ancestors feast and drink; -
Happiness and dignity lend them their aids.

鳧鷖在渚，公尸來燕來處。爾酒既湑，爾殽伊脯。公尸燕飲，福祿來下。

The wild ducks and widgeons are on the islets;
The personators of your ancestors feast and enjoy themselves.
Your spirits are strained,
Your viands are in slices;
The personators of your ancestors feast and drink; -
Happiness and dignity descend on them.

鳧鷖在潀，公尸來燕來宗。既燕于宗，福祿攸降。公尸燕飲，福祿來崇。

The wild ducks and widgeons are where the waters meet;
The personators of your ancestors feast, and are honoured.
The feast is spread in the ancestral temple,
The place where happiness and dignity descend.
The personators of your ancestors feast and drink; -
Their happiness and dignity are at the highest point.

鳧鷖在亹，公尸來止熏熏。旨酒欣欣，燔炙芬芬。公尸燕飲，無有後艱。

The wild ducks and widgeons are in the gorge;
The personators of your ancestors rest, full of complacency.
Your fine spirits are delicious,
Your flesh, roast and broiled, is fragrant;
The personators of your ancestors feast and drink; -
No troubles shall be theirs after this.


《鳧鷖》，五章，章六句。
