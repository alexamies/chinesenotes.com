毛詩序：「《北山》，大夫刺幽王也。役使不均，己勞於從事，而不得(終)養其父母焉。」


北山
陟彼北山，言采其杞。偕偕士子，朝夕從事。王事靡盬，憂我父母。

I ascend that northern hill,
And gather the medlars.
An officer, strong and vigorous,
Morning and evening I am engaged in service.
The king's business is not to be slackly performed;
And my parents are left in sorrow.

溥天之下，莫非王土。率土之濱，莫非王臣。大夫不均，我從事獨賢。

Under the wide heaven,
All is the king's land.
Within the sea-boundaries of the land,
All are the king's servants.
His great officers are unfair, -
Making me serve thus as if I alone were worthy.

四牡彭彭，王事傍傍。嘉我未老，鮮我方將。旅力方剛，經營四方。

My four horses never halt;
The king's business allows no rest.
They praise me as not yet old;
They think few like me in vigour.
While the backbone retains its strength,
I must plan and labour in all parts of the kingdom.

或燕燕居息，或盡瘁事國；或息偃在牀，或不已于行。

Some enjoy their ease and rest,
And some are worn out in the service of the State;
Some rest and loll upon their couches,
And some never cease marching about.

或不知叫號，或慘慘劬勞；或棲遲偃仰，或王事鞅掌。

Some never hear a sound,
And some are cruelly toiled;
Some lazily roost, on their backs looking up,
And some are all-bustled in the service of the king.

或湛樂飲酒，或慘慘畏咎；或出入風議，或靡事不為。

Some indulge long in pleasure and drinking,
And some are miserable, in apprehension of blame;
Some, at home and abroad, pass critical remarks,
And some have everything to do.

《北山》，六章：三章，章六句；三章，章四句。
