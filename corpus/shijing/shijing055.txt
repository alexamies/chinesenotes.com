毛詩序：「《載馳》，許穆夫人作也。閔其宗國顛覆，自傷不能救也，衞懿公為狄人所滅，國人分散，露於漕邑，許穆夫人閔衞之亡，傷許之小，力不能救，思歸唁其兄，又義不得，故賦是詩也。」


載馳
載馳載驅，歸唁衞侯，驅馬悠悠，言至于漕，大夫跋涉，我心則憂。

I would have galloped my horses and whipt them,
Returning to condole with the marquis of Wei.
I would have urged them all the long way,
Till I arrived at Cao.
A great officer has gone, over the hills and through the rivers;
But my heart is full of sorrow.

既不我嘉，不能旋反，視爾不臧，我思不遠。
既不我嘉，不能旋濟，視爾不臧，我思不閟。

You disapproved of my [proposal],
And I cannot return to [Wei];
But I regard you as in the wrong,
And cannot forget my purpose.
You disapproved of my purpose,
But I cannot return across the streams;
But I regard you as in the wrong,
And cannot shut out my thoughts.

陟彼阿丘，言采其蝱，女子善懷，亦各有行，許人尤之，衆穉且狂。

I will ascend that mound with the steep side,
And gather the mother-of-pearl lilies.
I might, as a woman, have many thoughts,
But every one of them was practicable.
The people of Xu blame me,
But they are all childish and hasty [in their conclusions].

我行其野，芃芃其麥，控于大邦，誰因誰極，大夫君子，無我有尤，百爾所思，不如我所之。

I would have gone through the country,
Amidst the wheat so luxuriant.
I would have carried the case before the great State.
On whom should I have relied? Who would come [to the help of Wei]?
Ye great officers and gentlemen,
Do not condemn me.
The hundred plans you think of
Are not equal to the course I was going to take.

《載馳》五章：一章六句，二章四句，一章六句，一章八句。
