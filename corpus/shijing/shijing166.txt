毛詩序：「《伐木》，燕朋友故舊也。自天子至于庶人，未有不須友以成者。親親以睦，友賢不棄，不遺故舊，則民德歸厚矣。」


伐木
伐木丁丁，鳥鳴嚶嚶。出自幽谷，遷于喬木。嚶其鳴矣，求其友聲。
相彼鳥矣，猶求友聲。矧伊人矣，不求友生。神之聽之，終和且平。

On the trees go the blows zheng-zheng;
And the birds cry out ying-ying.
One issues from the dark valley,
And removes to the lofty tree,
While ying goes its cry,
Seeking with its voice its companion.
Look at the bird,
Bird as it is, seeking with its voice its companion;
And shall a man,
Not seek to have his friends?
Spiritual beings will then hearken to him;
He shall have harmony and peace.

伐木許許，釃酒有藇。既有肥羜，以速諸父。寧適不來？微我弗顧。
於粲洒埽，陳饋八簋。既有肥牡，以速諸舅。寧適不來？微我有咎。

Xu-xu they go, as they fell the trees.
I have strained off my spirits, till they are fine,
And the fatted lambs are provided,
To which to invite my paternal uncles.
It is better that something should keep them from coming,
Than that I should not have regarded them.
Oh! brightly I have sprinkled and swept my courtyard,
And arranged my viands, with eight dishes of grain, along with my fatted meat,
To which to invite my maternal uncles.
It is better that something should keep them from coming,
Than that there should be blame attaching to me.

伐木于阪，釃酒有衍，籩豆有踐，兄弟無遠。民之失德，乾餱以愆。
有酒湑我，無酒酤我。坎坎鼓我，蹲蹲舞我。迨我暇矣！飲此湑矣！

They fell down the trees along the hill-side.
I have strained off my spirits in abundance;
The dishes stand in rows,
And none of my brethren are absent.
The loss of kindly feeling among people,
May arise from faults in the matter of dry provisions.
If I have spirits I strain them, do I;
If I have no spirits, I buy them, do I;
I make the drums beat, do I;
I lead on the dance, do I.
Whenever we have leisure,
Let us drink the sparkling spirits.

《伐木》，六章，章六句。
