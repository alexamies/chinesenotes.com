        Buddhist 佛教
      </h3>
      <p>
        Buddhist temples are filled with decorative designs, both on the architectural structures and on wooden artifacts inside the halls. If these artifacts are used in ceremonies they are usually referred to as Dharma instruments 法器. The Dharma Wheel 法轮 from the Sanskrit word Dharmacakra represents the teachings of the Buddha. There are usually eight spokes representing the Noble Eightfold Path 八正道.

        A wooden fish 木鱼 is a percussion instrument used in Buddhism. A fish, with eyes always open, symbolizes wakefulness. The wooden fish outside the food hall at Fayu Temple, Mount Putuo, shown below, is the largest one that I ever seen. This type of wooden fish is struck to let people know that it is dinner time.
