        Xia Dynasty 夏朝
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Bronze Age in China started with the Xia Dynasty in about 2,100 BCE.
        Ancient Chinese literature refers to nine large bronze ding that were ordered to be cast by the founder of the 
        Xia dynasty, Yu.
        They were later passed down in the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties but were lost when a ship carrying them sunk.
        There are relatively few historic records from the Xia dynasty and bronze ware is a key source of information about 
        this period.
        Many archeological discoveries were made in Erlitou, thought to be the capital of the Xia dynasty.

        Bronze ware artifacts were important possessions and indicators of social rank in the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.
        One of the reasons that bronze ware is better preserved than other historic artifacts is corrosion resistant material 
        property of bronze.
        In addition, bronze is tough enough to survive where pottery and other materials break.
        These artifacts from the Xia Dynasty, over three thousand years old, have survived well.

        Bronze was occasionally inlaid with gemstones, such as in the ornament above. However, most bronze ware at this stage was for vessels used in ceremonies that were central to the culture at this period. Jue 爵, such as the shown below, are a kind of wine vessel and are among the most commonly discovered artifacts from the early Bronze Age.
