        The same types of decorative designs have also been applied to carved stone. The specific designs vary with the context that they appear in. Carved stone is mostly used in architectural structures like temples, palaces, other important buildings, and tombs. The different types of carving include full form sculpture 圆雕, relief sculpture 浮雕, open work 透雕, and engraving 刻花.

        Before the invention of steel all carving was done by abrasion roughing out first with stone hammers. Metals developed before steel are not hard enough to carve any but the softest rocks. The use of steel chisels enabled the creation of fine stone carvings. Carving did was not well developed until about the end of the Han Dynasty (202 BCE —220 CE) and reached a peak in the Tang (618—907). Examples of well known locations of stone carvings in China are the Longmen Caves 龙门石窟 in Henan (Northern Wei to Northern Song), Mount Maiji Caves 麦积山石窟 in Gansu (Northern Wei to Qing), and Yungang Caves 云冈石窟 in Shanxi (fifth to sixth century).

        Relief sculptures can also be created using shallow relief with contrasting areas emphasized using different
        degrees of polish.
        An example of this is shown below in the bamboo relief sculpture where the raised areas have been polished.
        The purple granite resembles the color of the purple bamboo that is the namesake of the temple.
