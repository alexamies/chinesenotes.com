        The statues above and below include a scenes describing jataka stories 本生, which are stories from the life or a past life of the Buddha. They originate in Indian Buddhist art. The relief carving here is a mural style on a flat surface. This type of relief sculpture is produced by a multi-step process. In the first step a painter paints the design on the stone. In the second step a mason chisels lines around the outlines. In the third step the painter may have painted the stone.

        Large numbers implying nearly infinite quantities are common and important in Buddhism.
        The steele below is titled <span class='bookTitle'>Ten thousand Buddhas Steele</span>, not meaning ten thousand literally
        but a meaning a very large number.
        In China, ten thousand traditionally represents a large number or infinity.
        In Buddhist sutras this concept was represented by the number of grains of sand in the Ganges, the number of dust particles 
        created by turning a world into dust (Lotus Sutra), the amount of space in a particular direction (Diamond Sutra),
        or other analogies.
