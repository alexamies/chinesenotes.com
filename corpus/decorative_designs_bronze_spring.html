        Spring and Autumn Period
        春秋
      </h3>
      <p>
        In the Spring and Autumn Period the ceremonial rites of the Shang and Western Zhou changed as the Zhou clan lost power throughout the period. Some ceremonies reserved for the emperor, including those involving nine ding, were used by other nobles. As powers other than the Zhou clan rose the use of bronze became more widespread. At the same time techniques improved even more. The Rites of Zhou 周礼 recorded different proportions of copper to lead or tin for different types of bronze ware. The highest being 50% copper and 50% lead for use in mirrors. The wax-loss casting process was developed and techniques were standardized. The main advantage of the wax-loss process was high precision. More bronze artifacts for practical use appeared in this period, including household use and weapons.

The center leads to a contain that can be removed that was used to hold the wine. The other two holes were used to add hot water to heat the wine. Notice the fine taotie patterns within the dragon patterns in the detail picture. There are tiger and rhinoceros patterns around the neck.
