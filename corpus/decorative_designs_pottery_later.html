        <span class='bookTitle'>White pottery</span>, such as the <span class='bookTitle'>zun</span> shown above, was widespread in the Shang Dynasty and 
        the Western Zhou.
        The earliest piece of <span class='bookTitle'>white pottery</span> dates to circa 5,000 BCE.
        The <span class='bookTitle'>white pottery</span> that  appeared in the Shang was created from Kaolin clay, which was
        different to other clay types used for painted pottery and black pottery but very close in composition to the clay
        used for porcelain.
        <span class='bookTitle'>White pottery</span> was a transition to porcelain.

        The rat is one of the twelve animals of the Terrestrial Branches 生肖, sometimes loosely referred to as the Chinese Zodiac. The rat is a symbol of industry and prosperity based on the animals ability to locate and store supplies of food. The picture below shows a rat figurine from a collection of the twelve animals.

        Zisha 紫砂 is a style of pottery that uses a purple color clay, traditionally from the city of Yixing in Jiangsu. Zisha has been popularly used for tea pots since the late Tang. This is appropriate because Yixing is also an important tea growing center. The clays used have iron contents up to 9 percent, which is the origin of the reddish-brown to purple color. The items are fired in temperatures up to about 1,200 degrees Celcius, resulting in great hardness and density. The picture below shows a zisha brush rest with a cicada.
