        <span class='bookTitle'>White pottery</span>, such as the <span class='bookTitle'>zun</span> shown above, was widespread in the Shang Dynasty and 
        the Western Zhou.
        The earliest piece of <span class='bookTitle'>white pottery</span> dates to circa 5,000 BCE.
        The <span class='bookTitle'>white pottery</span> that  appeared in the Shang was created from Kaolin clay, which was

        Zisha 紫砂 is a style of pottery that uses a purple color clay, traditionally from the city of Yixing in Jiangsu. Zisha has been popularly used for tea pots since the late Tang. This is appropriate because Yixing is also an important tea growing center. The clays used have iron contents up to 9 percent, which is the origin of the reddish-brown to purple color. The items are fired in temperatures up to about 1,200 degrees Celcius, resulting in great hardness and density. The picture below shows a zisha brush rest with a cicada.
