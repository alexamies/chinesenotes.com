        References differ on the exact time of origin.
        [Li Li, 2004] provides a range from the Shang (c. 1700 to 1045 BCE) to the Zhou (1045—221 BCE).
        [<a href='decorative_designs_ref.php'>Fang 2010</a>] gives the Han Dynasty.
        The Shanghai Museum has several artifacts from the Spring and Autumn Period (770—476 BCE) and the
        Warring States Period (445—221 BCE) that it labels as Celadon.
        Two of those are shown below.

        There are several distinguishing characteristics of porcelain compared with other pottery:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Lower iron oxide and increase content aluminum oxide so that the body can be white
        </li>
        <li>
          Firing temperature of at least 1,200 degrees Celsius
        </li>
        <li>
          Use of glaze
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Glaze was usually made from quartz, feldspar, and clay.  It first appeared in the Shang but did not become widespread 
        until later.
        The artifacts above and below, produced in the Spring and Autumn Period, probably meet these criteria.
        Most early porcelain, like these items, has been discovered along the lower reaches of the Yantze and the 
        Southern Chinese coast.
