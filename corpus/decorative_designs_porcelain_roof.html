        Yellow porcelain roof tiles were used to cover structures associated with the emperor. Palace roofs use special glazed roof tiles called liuli way 琉璃瓦 that were for the exclusive use of the emperor. They took 180 days to make with a special purification process and two firings. The tile ends in the Forbidden City feature stamps with a dragon design. Over a hundred million tiles were used in building the Forbidden City in Beijing. The picture below shows a few of them.

        <span class='bookTitle'>Celestial beings and roof beasts</span> are used to decorate roofs in palaces and 
        temples.
        The use of nine of these in a row is reserved for the emperor.
        However, the Taihe Hall is unique in having 10 animals, making a total of 13 with the immortal gardian
        at the end.
        The celestial beings and roof beasts on the Taihe Hall are shown below.
