        Sakyamuni Buddha 释迦牟尼佛, also known as Siddhattha Gotama (c. 500 BCE), was the founder of Buddhism. 
        Bronze has a history of over 1500 years for Buddhist artifacts, mostly for statues, incense burners, and bells. The statue below is an early one from the Northern Wei. The striated pattern on the nimbus or halo 背光 behind the Buddha is very effective in bronze.

        Besides Sakyamuni Buddha, other buddhas are mentioned in Buddhist sutras. According to the Amitabha Sutra 阿弥陀经, Amitabha Buddha 阿弥陀 is the founder of the Western Pure Land 西方极乐世界. Chanting Amitabha Buddha's name is a common practice for the Pure Land School 净土宗 of Buddhism, which is one of the most common schools of Chinese Buddhism. In the bronze artifact below shows three Amitabha Buddha figures with hands showing speaking the Dharma mudra 说法印, indicating that Amitabha is expounding the teachings of the Buddha.
