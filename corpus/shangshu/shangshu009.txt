啟與有扈戰于甘之野，作《甘誓》。

大戰于甘，乃召六卿。

There was a great battle at Kan. (Previous to it), the king called together the six nobles, (the leaders of his six hosts),

王曰：「嗟！六事之人，予誓告汝：有扈氏威侮五行，怠棄三正，天用勦絕其命。今予惟恭行天之罰。左不攻于左，汝不恭命；右不攻于右，汝不恭命；御非其馬之正，汝不恭命。用命，賞于祖；弗用命，戮于社。予則孥戮汝。」

And said, 'Ah! all ye who are engaged in my six hosts, I have a solemn announcement to make to you. The lord of Hu wildly wastes and despises the five elements (that regulate the seasons), and has idly abandoned the three acknowledged commencements of the year. On this account Heaven is about to destroy him, and bring to an end his appointment (to Hu); and I am now reverently executing the punishment appointed by Heaven. If you, (the archers) on the left, do not do your work on the left, it will be a disregard of my orders. If you, (the spearmen) on the right, do not do your work on the right, it will be a disregard of my orders. If you, charioteers, do not observe the rules for the management of your horses, it will be a disregard of my orders. You who obey my orders, shall be rewarded before (the spirits of) my ancestors; and you who disobey my orders, shall be put to death before the altar of the spirits of the land, and I will also put to death your children.'
