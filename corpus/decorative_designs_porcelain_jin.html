        The Jun Kilns 钧窑 were well known in the Song and early Yuan. There were Jun Kilns all over Henan province. The kilns at Juntai and Baguadong produced porcelain for the Imperial Palace. The Jun Kilns used a translucent glaze colored with copper or iron to give a moon-white, sky-blue, rose-purple, or crab apple-red colors. Careful control of firing temperature, atmosphere, and glaze ingrdients was needed to create these colors. The June kilns also used very thick glaze. A jar from the Jun Kilns is shown below.
