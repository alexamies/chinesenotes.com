        Qing Dynasty 清
      </h3>
      <p>
        We know a lot about clothing in the Qing Dynasty because much of it was preserved and there is an abundant amount
        of written information and pictures.
        Some of the most interesting items of clothing during the Qing are those worn by the members of the Qing court.
        Because of its location, the Capital Museum in Beijing has a number of excellent items used by Qing emperors
        and others closely connected with him.
        The picture below shows an imperial table cover from the Qianlong reign (1736&mdash;1795).

        The picture below shows a dragon robe 龙袍, which was the emperor's court dress. Golden dragons are embroidered on, as shown in the detail, right. Also, notice the longevity character 寿 to the left of the dragon. The pattern is a traditional dragon playing with a pearl 龙戏珠 design. A common related design is two dragons playing with a pearl 二龙戏珠. These designs refer to a early Chinese literature and legend in Zhuang Zi 庄子 (369-286 BCE), an influential Chinese philosopher who lived during the Warring States Period, and others.
