        Western Zhou Dynasty 西周

        The Zhou clan overthrew Emperor Wuwang of the Shang Dynasty in 1,046 BCE. The zhi 觯, a kind of wine cup, below belonged to an official named Shan, who was rewarded with this prize for his part in a campaign to thwart a Zhou come back. The inscription inside the zhi provides valuable archaeological confirmation of ancient written records and that the commander of this particular battle was the Duke of Zhou 周公旦.

        Bronze artifacts continued to be central to customs and ceremonies in the Zhou. Many of these customs and ceremonies were recorded in The Book of Rites 礼记, thought to have originally been compiled by Confucius himself. However, it is believed that the version that exists today was reworked in the Han. Two other classics describing ceremonies in this period are The Rites of Zhou 周礼 and Yili or Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial 仪礼.

        The Western Zhou period ended in 771 BCE when some members of the ethnic tribe Quan Rong captured the Zhou capital and
        killed Emperor Youwang.
        The workmanship improved greatly in the Western Zhou resulting in some very high quality artifacts, even by modern 
        standards.

        The use of bronze ware artifacts in religious ceremonies of the Shang continued in the Zhou Dynasty.
        In addition to the vessels of the Shang, bronze musical instruments used in ceremonies have also been found.
        In the middle period, marked by the reigns of Emperor Muwang (976&mdash;922 BCE) and Emperor Yiwang (885&mdash;877BCE)
        artifact types and decorations changed.
        Wine and food vessels became less common and utensils and musical chimes became more dominant.
        Ribbon and abstract geometric patterns replaced the mythical taotie animal of the Shang Dynasty.
        The <span class='bookTitle'>kuilong</span> dragon pattern became popular.

        There are many idioms associated with ding. For example, 一言九鼎 “words of enormous weight”, literally one word worth nine sacred ding, the nine ding symbolizing the rule of China; and 大名鼎鼎 “renown.”

        The <span class='bookTitle'>gui</span> appeared in the Shang dynasty and is a food vessel for holding broomcorn millet and 
        other food. 
        In the Western Zhou the <span class='bookTitle'>gui</span> started to be used in even numbers with the ding in odd numbers.
        For example, the emperor would use nine <span class='bookTitle'>ding</span> and eight <span class='bookTitle'>gui</span> 
        and high level nobles would use seven <span class='bookTitle'>ding</span> with six <span class='bookTitle'>gui</span>.

        After ceremonial vessels, weapons made up the next greatest proportion of bronze ware.
        For example, in the Shang concubine <span class='bookTitle'>Fu Hao's</span> tomb, about 30 percent of the bronze
        artifacts were weapons.
        After the end of the Warring States Period, Emperor Qin Shi Huang, confiscated all bronze weapons. 
        Some of the bronze weapons, such as the battle ax below, were primarily for ceremonial use.
