        Blue and white porcelain 青花 is the most characteristically Chinese of all porcelain. It was first developed at Jingdezhen Kiln in the Tang and later mastered during the Yuan Dynasty. During the Yuan blue and white porcelain was made in limited quantities, mostly for export. The cobalt blue color was initially imported but later on mined within China from Leping in Jiangxi. However, during the Ming and Qing dynasties it became the most popular kind of porcelain. The Jingdezhen Kiln produced the highest quality and greatest volume of this kind of porcelain.

        The blue color was obtained from adding cobolt to the glaze.
        The blue underglaze was applied first and then a clear glaze applied over the top.
        It was fired in a single time at a high temperature.
        The plate shown below, also from Jingdezhen Kiln, has two lions playing with a ball, a symbol of power.

        During the Yuan Dynasty the ruling Mongols had an empire that stretched from China to Europe and trade expanded
        greatly.
        During this period most of the highest quality porcelain ended up outside of China.
        The Topkapi Palace in Turkey houses the largest collection of Yuan Dynasty blue and white porcelain in the world.
        Interestingly, most of the blue cobolt coloring was imported from West Asia.
        Export of porcelain on a large scale continued in the Ming and Qing dynasties.
        The plate below with Arabic text was probably intended for export to the West Asia.

        The plate below shows a <span class='bookTitle'>wucai</span> (five colored) design, which refers to a method for 
        applying the glaze.  This was an <span class='bookTitle'>overglaze</span> technique, meaning that the artwork was applied
        over the top of the glaze in addition to outlines created with <span class='bookTitle'>underglaze</span> outlines. 
        In blue and white porcelain, where the artwork is painted below the glaze with only <span class='bookTitle'>underglaze</span>.
        <span class='bookTitle'>Overglaze</span> porcelain uses a lower firing temperature, from 750 to 900 degrees Celsius.
        <span class='bookTitle'>Wucai</span> porcelain began to become popular in the mid to late Ming.
