    <h3 class='article'>Disambiguating different senses of a Chinese word</h3>
    <p>
       Chinese is a rich language with a long history and this leads to words
       that have many different meanings.  That is, the same character or
       combination of characters has different meanings in different contexts. 
       There are two different cases of this: (a) a <i>homonym</i>, where the
       words are truly different, and (b) <i>polysemy</i>, where there a
       multiple related senses of the word.

      Let's look at the example of the character 是 (pinyin: shì), which is one of the most common words in 
      Chinese that most often means 'is.'  There are eight different  meanings found for this character, 
      as shown in the screenshot below.

      To help decide on the meaning that applies to the Chinese sentence that 
      you are trying to understand, there are notes to help explain and
      differentiate the different meanings and senses. Below the list of 
      word senses are examples that the word is contained in.
