      <p>
        <strong>2018-07-12</strong>: Added a large number of texts to build out
        a digitial library for classical and historic texts including the 
        thirteen classics, twenty four histories, collections of poetry, and
        other texts, totalling over 39 million characters. See 
        <a href="/texts.html">Texts</a> for details.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2018-04-2</strong>: Did a major overhaul to the user interface,
        using <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>. Besides the
        nicer look and feel, it includes dialogs for each Chinese word in texts
        as well as mouse over. This is much easier to look up word details than
        links to word definitions because it allows you to better keep your
        place when reading a text and is much more mobile friendly. Also, added
        new texts for <a href="/shijing.html">The Book of Songs 《詩經》</a>,
        <a href="/tea_classic.html">The Classic of Tea 《茶經》</a>, and
        <a href="/shangshu.html">Book of Documents 《尚書》</a>.
      </p>
