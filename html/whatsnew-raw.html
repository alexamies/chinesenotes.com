        A large update to vocabulary, now with a total of over 140,000 entries
        and over 1,300 named entities separately in the 
        data/named_modern_entities.txt file. 
        Most of the new vocabulary is from CC-CEDICT with some cross checking
        in various sources.
        Also added the 千字文 <i>Thousand Character Classic</i>.

        A new text tokenizer was introduced that scans both left to right and
        right to left then compares the two. The scan with the least number of terms
        will be selected. The tokenization method used is similar in principle
        to previously. It is a greedy method that scans a chunk of text
        using the dictionary to tokenize text selecting the set of tokens that
        gives the least number of tokens. Since it is greedy, it is not always
        optimal. Previously, this was done with only left to right scanning.
        The change introduced right to left scanning in addition. The left to
        right scan is compared to the right to left scan and the one with the
        least number of tokens wins. This rarely happens but it can be confusing
        for readers when it does. For example, consider the phrase <br/>
        武裝的士兵 an armored soldier<br/>
        The left to right tokenizer will select<br/>
        武裝、的士、兵<br/>
        The right left tokenizer will select<br/>
        武裝、的、士兵<br/>
        The right to left tokenizer is correct but it takes a human to figure
        that out. In this case the number of tokens is the same and the left
        will be returned, so the result is ambiguous. This is part of an ongoing
        effort to improve the accuracy of the tokenizer. More work is required
        to help users in ambiguous cases like this.

        <strong>2019-06-09</strong>: 
        The Chinese Notes Chinese-English dictionary now contains over 2,000
        idioms.  Fixed a problem with the word frequency analysis for the corpus:

        Chinese-English dictionary. New number of headwords is 90,300.

        using <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>. Besides the

        as well as mouse over. This is much easier to look up word details than
        links to word definitions because it allows you to better keep your
        place when reading a text and is much more mobile friendly. Also, added
        new texts for <a href="/shijing.html">The Book of Songs 《詩經》</a>,
