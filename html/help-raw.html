    <h3 class='article'>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      There are number of innovations that make chinesenotes.com more useful
      than a printed dictionary, including looking up multipe words at once,
      looking up words in reverse based on an English search term, breaking
      Chinese text up into words, and finding similar phrases.
      They are explained here.

    <h3 id='phrases' class='article'>Breaking Chinese phrases into words</h3>
    <p>
      The chinesenotes.com dictionary can help you look up individual words or
      all the words in a phrase. Because Chinese words do not have spaces
      between them in sentences it can help to look up all the 
      words in a phrase.  Especially if you are a beginner or trying to make the
      jump from study to using Chinese in real life it can often be hard to
      figure out the boundaries between the words. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The website can also help to find similar words and phrases, if the term
      that you are searching for is not in the dictionary. The screenshot below
      shows the results for looking up the phrase 非一=善之功. This is not in the
      dictionary but the close match 非一日之功 'cannot be done in one day' is
      found and displayed.
