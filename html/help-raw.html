    <p>
      The chinesenotes.com dictionary can help you look up individual words or
      all the words in a phrase. Because Chinese words do not have spaces
      between them in sentences it can help to look up all the 
      words in a phrase.  Especially if you are a beginner or trying to make the
      jump from study to using Chinese in real life it can often be hard to
      figure out the boundaries between the words. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To look up all the words in a phrase or sentence cut-and-paste Chinese
      text into the text area.  
      Click the Search button to process the text.  The results will show the
      different words in the phrase.  The Hanyu Pinyin will be shown below that.
