      The <a href="/">www.chinesenotes.com</a> dictionary has lots of useful information about Chinese words.  
      In this section some of the basic information returned is explained.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at an example.  Try looking up the Chinese word 不過 (or
      simplified 不过).  A screen shot is shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class='picture'>
        <img class='use' src='images/word_detail_senses.png' 
          alt='Screenshot of word with multiple senses' 
          title='Screenshot of word with multiple senses'/>
          <div class='caption'>Screenshot of word with multiple senses</div>
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese text returned in large text with the simplified Chinese text
      first. If the traditional text is different then it will be shown in
      parentheses. In this csae there are multiple word senses, so each are
      listed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pinyin and part of speech for each sense is shown followed by one or
      more English equivalents. The domain label 'Modern Chinese' is shown below
      that. This is useful to distinguish between modern Chinese and literary
      Chinese 文言文 (also sometimes known as 古文 'classical Chinese') or other
      specialized terminology.
    </p>

      There are also some notes that give more information about the word and
      indicate which reference dictionaries were used to check the definition.
      These use a system of <a href='/abbreviations.html'>Abbreviations</a>.
