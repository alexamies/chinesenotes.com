        >Chinese Notes Chinese-English Dictionary Chrome Extension</a> is
        now available. The extension adds a context menu when text on a web page
        is selected so that term can be used to lookup and entry in the Chinese
        dictionary. You can lookup terms with simplified or traditional Chinese
        or pinyin, or reverse lookup with an English equivalent. See
        <a href='https://youtu.be/3ExNACiczyw'>demo</a> on Youtube for details
        on how to use it.

        To view status, disable or remove, in Chrome, go to Extensions -
        Manage extensions. The extension package includes the dictionary, which
        takes about 3 seconds to load and initialize indexes. Use it by
        selecting text on a page, right clicking, and selecting Lookup with
        Chinese Notes ...

        The extension is like the basic function of the chinesenotes.com web
        site but can be installed as a Chrome Extension. It can help you stay
        within the flow of a Chinese document, avoiding the need to switch
        back and forth between pages. The dictionary is well suited to literary
        Chinese and historic Chinese texts. Try it out on sites like the
        <a herf='https://ctext.org/'>Chinese Text Project</a>, 
        <a href='https://zh.wikipedia.org'>Chinese Wikipedia</a>,
        <a href='https://baike.baidu.com/'>Baidu Baike</a>, and others.

        You can also bring it up in its own tab for offline use.
