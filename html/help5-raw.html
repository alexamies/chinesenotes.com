      similarity of the character order, Pinyin match, and inclusion of the
      query in the notes. The potential matching terms to be indexed the
      translated phrases, named entity database (people, places, etc), or
      dictionary. For example, it may help find difficulty Korean, Japanese,

    <h3 class='article'>How does Translation Memory Work?</h3>
    <p>
      Translation memory works by searching on an index of all the terms in
      the dictionary, named entity databaes, and a bank of phrases. The terms
      with the most characters included (unigrams) are retrieved in the search.
      Terms with the same pinyin pronunciation are also retrieved and combined
      with the previous set. Each term is examined to see if it is a part
      (subtstring) of the term or vice-versa.
      Then the deviation from the exact order of the query (Hamming distance) is
      computed. 
      All of these aspects are scored and the scores summed up and sorted.
